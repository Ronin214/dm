Simple script for music install using yt-dlp

UPDATED TO 0.2

WHAT DO YOU NEED FOR WORK?

To work dm you need all the tools for working yt-dlp and yt-dlp itself

HOW IT WORK?

the script works like this:
the script gets the user's input on the amount of music to download, then it gets the url from the user's input, after which the os library starts its work, which writes the yt-dlp command and the prepared parameters: "-x --audio-format mp3 --embed-thumbnail --embed-metadata", after which yt-dlp starts downloading music to the current category/directory/folder, whatever you want to call it, but most importantly MAKE SURE YOU DOWNLOAD YT-DLP AND THE TOOLS FOR ITS WORK
